# Burp Suite Mastery Series

The Burp Suite Mastery Series is a **FREE** comprehensive, 72-episode training program meticulously crafted to teach cybersecurity professionals how to perform manual web application testing with surgical precision using Burp Suite. Designed for penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, AppSec engineers, and defensive architects, this series spans over 8 hours of structured video instruction, delivering everything from tool basics to advanced exploitation techniques, client-side logic abuse, API testing, identity manipulation, and strategic enterprise workflows. 

Structured into nine focused sections, the series begins with foundational setup and orientation, introducing the role of Burp Suite in modern testing ecosystems. Learners progress through core tool usage, mastering Proxy, Repeater, Decoder, Intruder, and WebSocket testing, before diving into real-world exploitation strategies involving input abuse, injection payloads, and DOM-based vulnerabilities. 

Moving beyond technical execution, the series provides powerful guidance on identity and session manipulation, federated authentication analysis (OAuth, JWT, SAML), and manual GraphQL and gRPC testing workflows. Each episode is aligned with OWASP Top 10 (2025) categories and emphasizes **manual testing methodology** encouraging learners to think critically about trust boundaries, user behavior, and application design flaws. 

In later sections, viewers tackle race conditions, cache poisoning, blind SSRF, and timing-based exploits using live request manipulation bridging theory with adversarial simulation. Specialized episodes offer insights into professional reporting, evidence capture, audit readiness, and TLS/SSL cryptographic analysis. 

Whether you're building a career in offensive security or fortifying your organization’s testing strategy, this series enables learners to: 

- Develop payload fluency and exploit logic with Burp’s manual tools 
- Understand and manipulate identity, session, and federated flows 
- Execute strategic vulnerability testing against APIs, browsers, and protocols 
- Conduct interface manipulation attacks (CORS, CSRF, clickjacking, spoofing) 
- Simulate advanced threat behaviors including beaconing, concurrency, and evasion 
- Translate technical findings into clear, defensible reports for audit or remediation
